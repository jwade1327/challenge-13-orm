# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Overview
AS A manager at an internet retail company

I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies

SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Installation
Node.JS

## Usage
Node.JS is required to run. After you install using 'npm i' in your terminal you will then have to setup your database, such as MySQL, which is what I used. Then you type 'npm run seed' followed by 'npm start' to run the serve through your localhost. I checked my api routes using InsomniaCore.

Here is a link to my walk through video.
